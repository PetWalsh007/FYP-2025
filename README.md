# Introduction
This repository contains the codebase for the development of a Real-Time Adaptive Data Analytics and Visualisation Platform designed for industrial data systems. The platform aims to bridge the gap between diverse industrial data sources (e.g., Historian, ERP, LIMS) and end-users, providing dynamic data analysis, distributed computing capabilities, and advanced visualisations.
